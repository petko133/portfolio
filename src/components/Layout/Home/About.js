              A dedicated Full Stack Web Developer based in Plovdiv, Bulgariaüìç
            </h3>
            <p className={classes['about-info']}>
              As a beginner Full Stack Web Developer, I possess a good arsenal
              of skill in JavaScript, NodeJS, React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS. I
              first started learning Python to begin my first steps into
              programming and it didn't take long to fall in love with it. After
              a while I got the opportunity to join a team of friends for a
              couple of months and learn JavaScript, TypeScript and NodeJS,
              with my focus being on the Back-End Development. After that I
              decided to also dive into Front-End Development with React.
